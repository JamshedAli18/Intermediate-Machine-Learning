# Intermediate-Machine-Learning

Handle missing values, non-numeric values, data leakage, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with the course, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python (latest version)
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Necessary Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost

## Course Outline

1. **Introduction**
   - Review what you need for this course.

2. **Missing Values**
   - Missing values happen. Be prepared for this common challenge in real datasets.

3. **Categorical Variables**
   - There's a lot of non-numeric data out there. Here's how to use it for machine learning.

4. **Pipelines**
   - A critical skill for deploying (and even testing) complex models with pre-processing.

5. **Cross-Validation**
   - A better way to test your models.

6. **XGBoost**
   - The most accurate modeling technique for structured data.

7. **Data Leakage**
   - Find and fix this problem that ruins your model in subtle ways.
